# creator-documentation

Welcome to the official documentation repository for Oppia where documentation is built. This repository is connected to the Read the Docs platform which hosts Oppia’s user guide.

## About Read the Docs

Read the Docs is an open source hosting platform for Sphinx-generated documentation. 

_Sphinx_ is a documentation generator and Sphinx documents are written in  a markup language called _reStructuredText_ (reST for short).

From a high-level perspective, the workflow for writing documentation in Sphinx looks like this:

1. Write the documentation in plain text files using reST.
2. Build the documentation (HTML output) using Sphinx on the command line.
3. Push docs to Oppia’s **creator-documentation** repository (or submit a pull request).
4. Read the Docs automatically builds and updates documentation from the repository.


## Contributing
