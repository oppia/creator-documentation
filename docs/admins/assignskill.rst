Assigning a skill to a subtopic
--------------------------------

When you initially assign a skill to a topic, it falls under the category of **Uncategorized Skills**. This means that they have not yet been assigned to any :ref:`subtopic <subtopic>`. 

To enable learners to review the skills associated with a topic, you will need to create subtopics and then assign skills to the subtopics. When learners begin a practice session, they will choose the subtopic they want to practice and then review the skills within that subtopic. 

1. To create a subtopic, click on the topic and then the **Subtopics editor** |subtopiceditor| button in the top-right corner.

.. |subtopiceditor| image:: /images/subtopics_editor.png
                    :scale: 30 %

2. To create a new subtopic, click on **+ Add Subtopic**, enter a title and click |createsubtopic|.

.. |createsubtopic| image:: /images/create_subtopic.png
                    :scale: 40 %

3. To assign skills to a subtopic, drag the skill from the list of **Uncategorized Skills** on the right side and drop it under the relevant subtopic. To remove a skill from the subtopic, drag the skill back to the Uncategorized Skills list.

   *Fig. 5* 

4. To unassign a skill from a topic, click the |trashcan| button next to the skill in the **Uncategorized Skills** list. This will not delete the skill, but move it back to the **Unused Skills** tab in the Topics and Skills dashboard.

.. |trashcan| image:: /images/trashcan.png
              :alt: Delete skill button
              :scale: 40 %

5. To delete a subtopic, click the red **X** next to the Subtopic Title. This moves any associated skills back to the **Uncategorized Skills** list.

6. To create a high-level description for the subtopic that learners will see in the practice session, click the |pencil| button next to the Subtopic Title. Enter the description in the text box under **Subtopic Page**. This will help learners decide which subtopics to practice.

            :scale: 40 %

.. important::

   Ensure that each subtopic contains a unique list of skills, i.e., skills are not repeated in different subtopics. 

7. When you have finished creating subtopics and assigning skills to them, click |savechanges|.

.. _createquestion:

Creating a question for a skill
--------------------------------

Questions can be created either through the Topic Editor or submitted by contributors. 

1. To create a question from the Topic Editor, click on the topic, and then the **Questions Editor** |questioneditor| button in the top-right corner.

.. |questioneditor| image:: /images/question_editor.png

2. Click the **Create Question** button.

3. Select the skill for which you want to create the question and click **Next**.

4. Select the question's level of difficulty—Easy, Medium or Hard—and click **Done**. If there were :ref:`rubrics <rubrics>` written for these levels when the skill was created, you will see them here.

5. The **Question Editor** box opens. This works just like an :ref:`Exploration Editor <createcontent>` where you can create questions, add interactions, responses and feedback. You also have to add a hint in order to publish the question. When you have finished creating the question, click |publishquestion|.
