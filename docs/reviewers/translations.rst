Reviewing Translations
======================

Oppia's lessons are translated to multiple languages to ensure a wide range of students across the world could learn in their own language. After translations are submitted, they are sent for review. As a reviewer, you can review all the translations in the language you have review right.

To start reviewing the translations:

1. Click on |reviewtranslationbtn| in the left sidebar to see the list of all the available translations awaiting review.

3. The left side text-box contains the original text in English and the right side text-box contains the translated text. Check if the translation is gramatically correct and conveys the same meaning as the original text. Please follow :ref:`the guidelines <reviewguidelines>`.
4. If you do not want to review, click on the |closebtn| button to close the modal.
5. If the translation is correct, click on |acceptandreviewnextbtn| button approve it and review the next translation. Adding a review message is not mandatory for while accepting a translation.
6. If the translation is not correct, type a review message in the text-box with the label 'Review message' explaining the reason for rejection, possible improvements and suggestions. This message would be visible to the translator. Note that you cannot reject a translation without a review message.  Click on the |rejectandreviewnextbtn| button to continue reviewing other translations.

Guiding Principles
-------------------
To ensure that translations convey the same meaning with same persuasiveness and simplicity as the original text, please keep these principles in mind:
 
 * Ensure that the the voice and meaning of the original text is preserved. It doesn't mean you have to accept only literal translations. If the language is natural and understandable that stays close to the source, the translation is worth accepting.
 * Ensure that *all* of the meaning in the original text is present in the translation.
 * Ensure that the translation choices are consistent.
 * Ensure that no information is added or subtracted during the translation.
 * Ensure that there are no gramatical errors or spelling mistakes in the translation. 

Note: While reviewing a translation, if you see broken images, do not accept the translation.
