Review Rights
================

Reviewing is critical in ensuring that the translations, questions and voiceovers submitted by the contributors are correct and error-free. In order to review questions, translations or voiceovers, a user must be authorised by the admin.

The review rights a user has are listed in the header of the contributor-dashboard under the My Contributions tab. Review rights for translations and voiceovers are language specific whereas that for questions is not. The languages in which you can review translations and voiceovers are also listed in the header.

The left sidebar shows options to review according to rights that you have.
