   :description lang=en: A comprehensive user guide for using the Oppia platform


Oppia is an open source learning platform with the goal of providing engaging content to learners. Anyone can create and share interactive lessons (explorations) with the aim of recreating a one-on-one tutoring scenario.    

This interactivity is what makes Oppia unique. Many of the educational tools on the Internet provide a unidirectional flow of information which makes it hard to create engaging, feedback-rich experiences for learners. However, Oppia comes with several built-in interactions and responses that make it possible to personalize feedback to a learner's answer. Over time, explorations can be improved as more learners engage with the content. 

Oppia's mission is to provide high-quality, accessible learning experiences to everyone around the world.
