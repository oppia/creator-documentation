.. _interactions:

.. topic:: Add Interactions

   Now that you've posed a question, the next step is to add an :ref:`interaction <interaction>`â€”the type of answer the learner might give.

   .. admonition:: Interactions
   
      How do you want your learner to answer the question? Do you want them to type in an answer, or choose items from a selected list? Oppia has several built-in interactions including fraction or number inputs that you can choose from.

   6. To add an interaction, click |addinginteraction| and select the desired interaction which will bring up the **Customize Interaction** box. The customization options will depend on the type of interaction chosen. In the example below, we have selected the **Multiple Choice** interaction.

   7. When you have finished customizing the Interaction, click on the |saveinteraction| button.

.. _responses:

.. topic:: Add Responses

   The next step is to add responses.

   .. admonition:: Responses
   
      The Response section is where you decide how Oppia should respond based on the learner's answer. Include some constructive feedback about why an answer was wrong. Even if they have answered correctly, explain why the answer was right.

   8. After you save an interaction, the **Add Response** pop-up box appears.

   9. Choose the learner's possible answer, and add the appropriate response or feedback. To add a new response, click the |addanother| button.

   10. At least one of the answer groups must be marked as correct as shown in the image below.

      *Fig. 5*

   11. When you have finished adding responses, click the |saveresponse| button. This brings you back to the Editing screen where you can view the responses you've created. From here, you can add a new response, or edit or delete the responses you've created by clicking on the relevant box. 

   .. |saveresponse| image:: /images/save_response.png

   12. You will notice a checkbox titled **Solicit Answer Details** when you come back to the Editing screen. If you would like Oppia to ask the learner to explain why they chose the answer on that card, checkmark this box. You can find more details on this in the :ref:`Improvements tab <answerdetails>` page.

   The final step is to add a Hint.

   13. To add a hint to the question card, click the |addhint| button at the bottom of the Editing screen.
