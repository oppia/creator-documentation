.. _advancedfeatures:

Advanced Features
------------------

**Automatic Text-to-speech**

This setting is available under **Advanced Features**. The Automatic Text-to-speech feature is enabled by default and automatically generates audio from the text in your cards.

When the feature is enabled, learners will see an **Audio** button as they play through the exploration, which will generate a computerized reading of your card.
If you disable the feature, the button is not visible to learners.

.. tip::

   Disable the text-to-speech feature if your exploration content consists of multiple languages.

**Correctness Feedback**

The **Correctness Feedback** feature lets students know when they have selected a right answer by displaying a short animation that looks like this:

   *Fig. 4*


1. To enable this feature, click on |settings|, go to **Advanced Features** and click the button next to **Correctness Feedback** so that it is 'On'.

2. In the Editing |pencil| screen, you will now see an option to identify an answer group as correct in the **Learner's Answers and Oppia's Responses** section. Checkmark the box within the correct answer group. You can add several possible answers to a group if there is more than one correct answer.

3. Save your changes. Now the learner will be able to view the 'Correct' animation if they input an answer you have identified as 'correct'.

.. _emailpref:

Changing Email Preferences
----------------------------

The default setting in Oppia is for an exploration creator to receive notifications whenever a learner submits :ref:`feedback <feedback>` or :ref:`suggestions <suggestions>` for your exploration.

You can stop these notifications by clicking the **Mute** button under **Feedback/Suggestion Email Preferences**.
